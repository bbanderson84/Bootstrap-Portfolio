                                    <p> I grew up in Charlevoix, MI, which is a small town in Northern Michigan. I attended my undergraduate studies at Michigan State University and received my Bachelor's of Science in Psychology. After I graduated, I moved to Chicago, IL to pursue a Master's Degree in Organizational Psychology. The Windy City quickly became home, and for 7 years that is where I resided and held positions ranging from Recruiting Coordinator, to Project Coordinator at different companies.</p>
                                    <p> I relocated to Denver, CO and got a job at Dish Network working in Recruiting. After a few years, I realized that I wanted something more out of my career and I wanted somewhere I could focus and put my creativity. I have always been fascinated with web pages, applications, and different software that everyone uses in their daily lives. Being able to build something for others to use, and seeing the final result has always been rewarding for me.</p>
                                    <p> My cousin does developing, and after speaking with him and doing some research I decided to give it a go. Just like Denver, I immediately fell in love with the aspect of developing and coding, being able to create something from start to finish and offer any creativity that could showcase my personality. It is my goal for this website to offer a viewing of my work and projects to showcase just how important this is for me.</p>
                                    <p> Please feel free to explore this website and my portfolio of projects that I have completed since becoming a developer. </p>
